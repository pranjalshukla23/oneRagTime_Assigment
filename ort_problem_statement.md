# OneRagtime tech interview

You are tasked with solving the following problem.

You are given a file input (attached) that consists of lines of alpha-numeric characters. Each line contains a hidden value that you need to recover. On each line, the hidden value can be found by combining the **first digit** and the **last digit** (in that order) to form a single two-digit number.

For example:

```
1rew9
hsg8jkghr1ew
hj42ljk523j4h5g
zlwpfoejd
ixm9ricu
```

In this example, the values of these four lines are 19, 81, 45, -, and 99, respectively. Adding these together produces 244.

What is the sum of all the values in the document attached?
